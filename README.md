This is my project for my ITT-Tech class SD1340 (3rd quarter).  The project is to be of a worthwhile subject, something that will be useful in the future, worth sharing with other people, and can be mobile or web-based.  
I am doing a website for my daughter's photography business that will include gallery slideshows, an about page, a pricing page, and a contact page.
